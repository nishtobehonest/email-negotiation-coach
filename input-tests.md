Best regards,

## Test 2: Polite Collaborative Framing with Institutional Leverage

We look forward to your thoughts.

## How to Use

- Run one test at a time
- Observe consistency of categories
- Check that no replies are drafted
- Validate that checklist gaps change with context

If the same checklist gaps appear for every test, the prompt needs tightening.
